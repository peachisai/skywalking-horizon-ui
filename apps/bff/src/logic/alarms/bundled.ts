/**
 * Bundled defaults for the Alert page-setup template. Lives next to the
 * layer and overview bundled JSON so the sync orchestrator can treat all
 * three families uniformly — there's exactly one alert template
 * (`horizon.alert.page-setup`) and it ships with the BFF.
 *
 * Resolved via the same path-search as the layer loader: dev source tree
 * first, then the packaged dist layout. Keeps the file readable and
 * editable in dev without forcing a rebuild step.
