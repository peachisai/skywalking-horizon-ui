/**
 * `/api/admin/layer-templates*` — admin CRUD for the per-layer JSON
 * templates that drive the dashboards / service-list / overview blocks.
 *
 *   GET  /api/admin/layer-templates           — list every loaded layer.
 *   POST /api/admin/layer-templates/:key      — write one template back
 *                                                to its JSON file; the
 *                                                in-memory cache is
 *                                                invalidated so the
 *                                                next read sees the new
 *                                                shape immediately.
