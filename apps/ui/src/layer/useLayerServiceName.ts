 * Resolve the selected service's NAME for a layer tab — sample first,

 * The landing rollup only carries the metric-probed sample (the top
 * `query.landingServiceCap` services), so a service picked from the long
 * tail of a big layer — or arriving via a deep link — is NOT in
 * `sampledRows`. Resolving names from the sample alone returns `null` for
 * those, which silently breaks the tab's per-service query (logs/traces
 * fire with no service; endpoint-dependency never enables). We look in
 * the sample first (already loaded), then fall back to the full roster
 * (`useLayerServices`), so EVERY selectable service yields a name. `null`
 * only when the id is in neither (genuinely unknown / not yet loaded).
 *
 * This is the single source of truth for service-name resolution across
 * every per-layer tab. Keep the lookup here — re-inlining it is exactly
 * how tabs drifted into sample-only lookups that drop tail selections.
