/**
 * vue-query wrapper around `GET /api/layer/:key/service-hierarchy`.
 *
 * Lazy-probed on node-select in the service map: one round-trip per
 * selected service answers both "should the expand chip show?" and
 * "what populates the overlay?" — `relations === 0` means the focused
 * service has no cross-layer projections, so the chip stays hidden.
 *
 * Not subscribed to the global auto-refresh ticker. The hierarchy
 * table doesn't drift on the OAP minute boundary; the only thing that
 * invalidates it is a layer/service switch, which is part of the
 * queryKey. Topology pages own enough refetch noise already.
