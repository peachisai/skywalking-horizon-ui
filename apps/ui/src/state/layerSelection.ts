/**
 * In-memory store for the layer dashboard's current
 * service/instance/endpoint selection.
 *
 * Lifecycle: **per layer**. The selection survives intra-layer
 * navigation (switching between the Service / Instance / Endpoint /
 * Trace / Logs / Topology tabs in the sidebar) so the operator's
 * pick is sticky while they explore that layer. When the operator
 * leaves to a different layer, the store resets — the previous
 * layer's service id is meaningless on the new layer's roster, and
 * carrying it over fired a stale "service not found" modal.
 *
 * URL deep-linking: a layer URL with `?service=<id>` (and optionally
 * `?instance=` / `?endpoint=`) seeds the store on entry. The seed
 * is read once per layer change — switching tabs within the layer
 * doesn't re-read. The downstream auto-pick watch waits for the
 * FULL service roster to load and silently swaps to the first
 * available service only if the URL-seeded id isn't in the layer.
 * Stale-id "service not found" modals are gone.
 *
 * No localStorage persistence — refreshing starts fresh, reading
 * the URL's query params if present.
