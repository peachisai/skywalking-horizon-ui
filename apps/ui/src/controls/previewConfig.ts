/**
 * Forward an operator's unpublished draft config block to the BFF in
 * preview mode.
 *
 * Pages that fetch a SINGLE template-driven config directly from the BFF
 * (topology, endpoint-dependency, traces, network-profiling) resolve the
 * REMOTE template server-side, so they ignore a local draft unless the UI
 * hands the draft over. This composable produces a reactive JSON string of
 * the previewed layer template's `<block>` — `undefined` outside preview
 * mode or when there's no draft — for passing to that route's
 * `previewConfig` arg. Including it in the route's queryKey makes the page
 * re-render when the operator edits + re-previews. Mirrors how the config
 * bundle already overlays drafts for the dashboard / overview list views.
