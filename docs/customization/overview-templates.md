# Overview Templates

An **overview template** is a JSON file describing a war-room / cross-cutting dashboard composed from MQE-driven widgets on a 12-column grid. Overviews are independent of any single layer and are designed for the operator's "is everything OK?" pane.

Bundled templates: `apps/bff/src/bundled_templates/overviews/<id>.json`. Examples:

- `services.json` — cross-layer service health + Kubernetes capacity summary.
- `mesh.json` — Istio data-plane services + pilot activity + Kubernetes.

## Top-level shape

```json
{
  "id": "services",
  "title": "Service Health",
  "description": "Cross-layer service traffic, latency, errors, and capacity.",
  "visibility": "public",
  "icon": "services",
  "order": 1,
  "layers": ["GENERAL", "MESH", "K8S_SERVICE"],
  "widgets": [
    { "type": "section-break", "title": "Service traffic", "cols": 12 },
    { ... metric widget ... },
    { ... kpi-tile ... },
    { "type": "section-break", "title": "Cluster capacity", "cols": 6 },
    { ... metric-composite ... }
  ]
}
```

## Top-level fields

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | **required** | Stable id, used in the route `/overview/:id`. |
| `title` | string | **required** | Display title in the sidebar and page header. |
| `description` | string | — | One-line description shown under the title. |
| `visibility` | `public` \| `operate` | `public` | Sidebar placement. `operate` puts the overview under the Operate group (admin-only by convention). |
| `icon` | string | — | Sidebar icon name (from Horizon's icon set). |
| `order` | number | — | Sort order within the visibility bucket (lower = earlier). |
| `layers` | string[] | — | Layer enums this overview aggregates. Optional — Horizon also unions in every widget's `layer` field, so a dashboard created via "+ New" (no `layers[]`) gates correctly off its widgets alone. See *Sidebar visibility* below. |
| `widgets` | array | **required** | Ordered widget list. The renderer iterates and lays out per the grid model. |

## Widget types

Six supported `type` values:

| Type | Renders |
|---|---|
| `metric` | Single MQE scalar with optional unit. |
| `topology` | Service-map snapshot for the configured layer. |
| `section-break` | Visual row header; carries `cols` to override the grid column count for following widgets. |
| `kpi-tile` | Compound tile: optional service count + N KPI rows. |
| `alarms` | Active-alarm rail (60 min window). |
| `metric-composite` | Mixed KPI grid — number tiles + progress-bar rows. |

See [Components → Overview Widgets](../components/overview-widgets.md) for the per-widget detail.

## Grid model

The overview renders on a CSS grid:

- Per-section column count, default 12, set by the most recent `section-break.cols`.
- Fixed row height 72 px.
- Per-widget `span` (column width, 1–12) and `rowSpan` (row height, 1–8).
- Gap 12 px between widgets.
- Single-column responsive collapse below 1100 px viewport.

The 72 px row height is tuned for KPI tile content; widgets that need more vertical space (a small chart, a multi-row composite) use `rowSpan: 2` or `rowSpan: 3`.

## Widget shape (common fields)

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `id` | Unique within the dashboard. |
| `title` | Card title (not used by `section-break` — uses `title` as the section header). |
| `tip` | Optional one-line hover hint next to the title. |
| `layer` | Layer key (UPPER_SNAKE). Used to scope MQE evaluation. Optional for `section-break` and `alarms` (alarms can scope server-side if the layer is set). |
| `type` | One of `metric`, `topology`, `section-break`, `kpi-tile`, `alarms`, or `metric-composite`. |
| `span` | Column span. Defaults vary per widget type. |
| `rowSpan` | Row span. Defaults vary per widget type. |
| `mqe`, `unit`, `aggregation` | Metric-specific fields. |
| `cols` | Section-break column count for following widgets. |
| `kpis`, `showCount`, `limit` | Type-specific fields described below. |

## `OverviewKpi`

Used by `kpi-tile` and `metric-composite`:

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `label` | Row label. |
| `mqe` | Required when `source === 'mqe'` (the default). |
| `unit` | Unit suffix. |
| `aggregation` | `sum` for throughput / count; `avg` for ratios and rates. |
| `style` | `number` (default) or `progress-bar`. |
| `max` | Required when `style === 'progress-bar'` — the 100% value. |
| `source` | `mqe` (default) or `service-count` — the latter reads the layer's service count from the menu response instead of evaluating MQE. |

## Worked examples

### `metric` widget

```json
{
  "id": "total_rpm",
  "title": "Total RPM",
  "type": "metric",
  "layer": "GENERAL",
  "mqe": "sum(service_cpm)",
  "unit": "rpm",
  "aggregation": "sum",
  "span": 3,
  "rowSpan": 1
}
```

Single scalar tile. The MQE collapses to one number (here, `sum` over the time window).

### `kpi-tile` with service count + two KPIs

```json
{
  "id": "general_summary",
  "title": "General services",
  "type": "kpi-tile",
  "layer": "GENERAL",
  "showCount": true,
  "span": 4,
  "rowSpan": 3,
  "kpis": [
    {
      "label": "Apdex",
      "mqe": "avg(service_apdex/10000)",
      "aggregation": "avg",
      "style": "progress-bar",
      "max": 1
    },
    {
      "label": "P95",
      "mqe": "avg(service_percentile{p='95'})",
      "unit": "ms",
      "aggregation": "avg"
    }
  ]
}
```

`showCount: true` adds a service-count header row above the KPIs.

### `metric-composite` — mixed number + bar grid

```json
{
  "id": "k8s_summary",
  "title": "Cluster capacity & utilisation",
  "type": "metric-composite",
  "layer": "K8S",
  "span": 12,
  "rowSpan": 3,
  "kpis": [
    { "label": "Nodes", "mqe": "latest(k8s_cluster_node_total)", "aggregation": "avg" },
    { "label": "Pods",  "mqe": "latest(k8s_cluster_pod_total)",  "aggregation": "avg" },
    { "label": "CPU",
      "mqe": "k8s_cluster_cpu_cores_requests / k8s_cluster_cpu_cores * 100",
      "unit": "%", "aggregation": "avg",
      "style": "progress-bar", "max": 100 },
    { "label": "Memory",
      "mqe": "k8s_cluster_memory_requests / k8s_cluster_memory * 100",
      "unit": "%", "aggregation": "avg",
      "style": "progress-bar", "max": 100 }
  ]
}
```

The widget auto-splits KPIs:

- `number`-style KPIs (Nodes, Pods) go into the count-tile row (auto-fit, min 100 px).
- `progress-bar`-style or `unit === '%'` KPIs go into the bar grid (auto-fit, min 180 px).

This single widget replaces what used to be three separate hand-crafted widgets (`k8s-service-count`, `pilot`, `service-count`) — anything compound now goes through `metric-composite`.

### `section-break` to start a new row

```json
{ "type": "section-break", "title": "Cluster capacity", "cols": 6 }
```

Following widgets render in a **6-column** grid (rather than 12) until the next `section-break`. Used for paired side-by-side panes.

### `alarms` rail

```json
{
  "id": "active_alarms",
  "title": "Active alarms (60 min)",
  "type": "alarms",
  "layer": "GENERAL",
  "limit": 10,
  "span": 4,
  "rowSpan": 4
}
```

Read-only — Horizon does not support acknowledge / close / silence operations. Alarm recovery is backend-automatic.

## Sidebar visibility

An overview entry appears in the sidebar only when **at least one of its declared layers is currently reporting services**. Declared layers come from two sources, unioned:

- the explicit `layers[]` field on the dashboard, and
- every `widget.layer` referenced by its widgets.

A dashboard with no layer reference on either side (no `layers[]` and no widgets with `layer` set — e.g. a future cross-layer "All" overview) is always shown.

This makes the sidebar honest: it stops listing a Services dashboard when nothing is reporting and lights it back up automatically when an agent / receiver does start, on the same 60-second cadence the menu refreshes. It also means a dashboard you create via "+ New" — which has no `layers[]` — gates correctly off its widgets without you having to maintain a separate list.

## Admin Editor

Overview templates are editable at runtime via **Dashboard setup → Overview templates** (`/admin/overview-templates`, verb `overview:write`). Pick a dashboard from the filterable dropdown (title + id + sync status), then lay it out on a **12-column canvas**: drag a widget to reorder, corner-drag to resize, click a widget to edit it in the right-hand drawer. Section breaks ("text widget" / line break) and the dashboard title are selectable too. The canvas shows **sample data** so you can judge layout; only the live page (Preview ▾) uses real OAP data.

**Per-widget fields** (the drawer shows only what the `widget.type` needs):

| Type | Fields shown |
|---|---|
| `section-break` | `title`, `cols` |
| `metric` | `layer`, `title`, `tip`, `mqe`, `unit`, `aggregation`, `span`, `rowSpan` |
| `topology` | `layer`, `title`, `tip`, `span`, `rowSpan` |
| `alarms` | `layer`, `title`, `tip`, `limit`, `span`, `rowSpan` |
| `kpi-tile` | `layer`, `title`, `tip`, `showCount`, KPI rows (add / remove), `span`, `rowSpan` |
| `metric-composite` | `layer`, `title`, `tip`, KPI rows (each a stacked card: label / source / MQE / unit / aggr / style / max), `span`, `rowSpan` |

### How edits flow: draft → preview → publish

Same model as [layer templates](/customization/layer-templates): your edit lives **in your browser**, and the live page everyone sees stays on the published OAP version until you publish.

1. **Save (local).** Stores your draft in this browser only; the dashboard is tagged **local** in the picker.
2. **Reset to ▾** loads the **Bundled** or **Remote** version into the canvas.
3. **Preview ▾** opens the real overview page in a new tab rendering **Local** / **Bundled** / **Remote**.
4. **Check diff & push** shows a *remote → local* diff and publishes to OAP (create-or-update). Enabled only when your draft differs from remote.

A **+ New dashboard** form (inside the picker) creates a dashboard the same way: it writes a **local draft** (id is the template name, must be unique) — edit and preview it, then **Check diff & push** publishes it to OAP. A pushed dashboard with no bundled default is **remote-only**; the picker, the live page, and the sidebar all show it.

A top banner summarizes state — *Synced from OAP — N diverged, Y local* — with **Diverged** / **Local** filters. Status chips per row: **synced**, **diverged** (OAP wins at render), **remote-only**, **disabled** (deleted), **bundled**.

### Deleting a dashboard

OAP has no hard delete, so the **Delete** button next to the title soft-disables the dashboard on OAP (a disabled dashboard drops from the picker's live state, the sidebar, and the live page). A dashboard that exists only as an unpublished local draft is removed from your browser instead. Either action is confirmed in a dialog first; deletion is irreversible from the UI, but a new dashboard can always be created with the same id.

## Hot reload

Admin editor changes apply on the next overview refresh. Bundled file changes made outside Horizon require a BFF restart.

## Common patterns

### A war-room single-screen view

One overview, `id: war-room`, with `layers: [ALL_YOUR_LAYERS]`, and:

1. `section-break` "Health" + 4 × `kpi-tile` (one per critical layer with service-count + RPS / error-rate KPIs).
2. `section-break` "Alarms" + 1 × `alarms` widget (span 12) showing every firing alarm.
3. `section-break` "Capacity" + 1 × `metric-composite` (span 12) with cluster capacity.

Layout fits a 1440 px display above the fold; works on a wall projector at 1920 px.

### A team-specific overview

`visibility: operate`, only granted to the team's role via `landingByRole`:

```yaml
landingByRole:
  payments-on-call: /overview/payments
```

The team lands directly on their own overview after login.

### Replacing the old k8s / pilot / service-count widgets

Use `metric-composite` with one widget per cluster summary. The old per-feature widget types are no longer rendered — `metric-composite` is the unified shape.
