/**

 * (`listLayers`, `getMenuItems`, `listLayerLevels`) into a single roundtrip
 * and stitches the result into the shape below — same as what the sidebar
 * (`apps/ui/src/components/shell/layers.ts`) renders.
 *
 * `caps` flags reflect what the LAYER supports; the UI hides rows whose
 * cap is false. `slots` carries per-layer term aliases (e.g. General's
 * endpoint → "API"). Layer-level overrides (term aliases, menu mode) live
 * in `horizon.yaml` and per-user state — the BFF merges all three sources.
