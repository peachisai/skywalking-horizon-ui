/**
 * Per-layer dashboard wire types.
 *
 * The Dashboards tab on each layer page renders a grid of widgets. Each
 * widget is one or more MQE expressions plus presentation hints (chart
 * type, unit, position in a 24-column grid — mirrors booster-ui's
 * grid units for visual parity).
 *
 * Defaults per layer are seeded from `apps/bff/src/dashboard/defaults.ts`
 * — those defaults are lifted from the equivalent booster-ui templates
 * so the metric coverage matches what operators expect on day one.
 * Operators edit + persist their own widget set via the Dashboard
 * setup admin pages, which write the override to OAP through the
 * UI-template sync surface.

/**
 * Built-in widget renderers.
 *
 *   card   — single scalar (avg across the window)
 *   line   — one labeled series per expression
 *   top    — sorted list with optional tab-switchable expressions
 *   record — tabular record list, one row per RECORD-typed MQE result.
 *            Used for "slow statements" / slow-SQL widgets and similar
 *            row-level views where each entry has a name + value +
 *            optional refs (trace id, span id) rather than a metric
 *            sample. The runtime is responsible for the table render;
 *            the admin canvas previews with mock rows.
 *   table  — key→value table for a LABELED `latest(...)` metric. Each
 *            label combination becomes a row (name = label values),
 *            with an optional value column. Mirrors booster-ui's Table
 *            graph for label-dimensioned meters (pod phase per service,
 *            node condition, deployment replicas, …) that a scalar card
 *            or a time-series line cannot represent.
