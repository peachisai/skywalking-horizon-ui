/**

 * The Dashboards tab on each layer page renders a grid of widgets. Each

 *
 * Defaults per layer are seeded from `apps/bff/src/dashboard/defaults.ts`
 * — those defaults are lifted from the equivalent booster-ui templates

/**
 * Built-in widget renderers.
 *
 *   card   — single scalar (avg across the window)
 *   line   — one labeled series per expression
 *   top    — sorted list with optional tab-switchable expressions
 *   record — tabular record list, one row per RECORD-typed MQE result.
 *            Used for "slow statements" / slow-SQL widgets and similar
 *            row-level views where each entry has a name + value +
 *            optional refs (trace id, span id) rather than a metric
 *            sample. The runtime is responsible for the table render;
 *            the admin canvas previews with mock rows.
 *   table  — key→value table for a LABELED `latest(...)` metric. Each
 *            label combination becomes a row (name = label values),
 *            with an optional value column. Mirrors booster-ui's Table
 *            graph for label-dimensioned meters (pod phase per service,
 *            node condition, deployment replicas, …) that a scalar card
 *            or a time-series line cannot represent.
 *   tab    — a container: one grid slot holding several full widgets (any
 *            of the above) shown as switchable tabs. It carries no MQE of
 *            its own (see `tabs`); only the active tab's child is queried.

/**
 * Structured widget visibility predicate. When set on a widget, the BFF
 * evaluates it and flags the widget's result `hidden: true` when the
 * predicate is false; the SPA drops hidden widgets from the grid.
 *
 * Two kinds:
 *   - `mqe`    — gate on an MQE expression's result. `exists` passes when
 *               at least one non-null value appears anywhere in the result
 *               (every labeled series, every bucket). `gt` / `lt` pass when
 *               at least one value is above / below `value`. When the
 *               expression is one of the widget's own `expressions` it is a
 *               *self-gate* (evaluated from the widget's own data, no extra
 *               query); otherwise it is a *group-gate* — the BFF probes the
 *               expression once for all widgets that share it and skips the
 *               whole group's MQE when it fails.
 *   - `entity` — gate on the active entity's attributes. Only meaningful on
 *               the Instance scope (Service / Endpoint entities carry no
 *               attribute bag). `exists` passes when the named attribute is
 *               present with a non-empty value; `eq` compares it to `value`
 *               case-insensitively (e.g. `attribute: 'language', value: 'java'`
 *               matches OAP's uppercase `JAVA`). On non-Instance scopes an
 *               entity gate is a no-op (always visible).
 *
 * Legacy free-text predicates (`"<metric> has value"`, `#entity.<key>`) are
 * no longer parsed — they degrade to ungated (the BFF's tolerant schema maps
 * any non-conforming value to `undefined`).
