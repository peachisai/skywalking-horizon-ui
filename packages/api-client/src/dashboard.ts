 * Per-layer dashboard wire types.

 * The Dashboards tab on each layer page renders a grid of widgets. Each
 * widget is one or more MQE expressions plus presentation hints (chart
 * type, unit, position in a 24-column grid — mirrors booster-ui's
 * grid units for visual parity).
 *
 * Defaults per layer are seeded from `apps/bff/src/dashboard/defaults.ts`
 * — those defaults are lifted from the equivalent booster-ui templates
 * so the metric coverage matches what operators expect on day one.
 * Phase 7 admin lets operators edit + persist their own widget set.
