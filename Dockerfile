# From-source, multi-arch image. Single source of truth for every image
# build: CI (GHCR), local dev, and the manual Docker Hub release push.
#
# Why from-source (not copy-in): `dist/node_modules` carries argon2's
# native binding, which is architecture-specific. Building `dist/` INSIDE
# the image — once per target platform — lets one `buildx --platform
# linux/amd64,linux/arm64` invocation compile the correct binding for each
# arch (native on a matching runner, QEMU-emulated otherwise). A copy-in
# image cannot do this from a single host.
#
#     docker build -t horizon-ui:local .          # single-arch dev build
#     docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t … --push .
#
# Trade-off: the build needs the network (`pnpm install`) — but only in the
# throwaway build stage. The final shipped stage is network-free.

# ---- build stage: compile the self-contained dist for THIS platform ----
# Throwaway BUILD ENVIRONMENT — uses the network (`pnpm install`) and
# carries the compiler toolchain. Discarded; only the final stage ships.
